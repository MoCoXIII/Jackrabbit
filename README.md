# Jackrabbit
3D Game using SDFs for rendering.
I know that it works on Chrome on my laptop but WebGL 2.0 is not very widely supported so I'm unsure about how well it'll work on other browsers.

For the single player (keyboard) version, visit https://mocoxiii.github.io/Jackrabbit/jackrabbit%20(mouse%20and%20keyboard,%201%20player)/game.html

For the co-op (controller) version, visit https://mocoxiii.github.io/Jackrabbit/jackrabbit%20(Controller%2C%202%20player)/game.html
